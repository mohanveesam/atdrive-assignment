Order Management Application:
This is a simple full-stack application built using Angular (frontend) and Node.js + Express + MySQL + MongoDB (backend).

I have added only node_modules to .gitignore. All other files, including the .env file, are pushed to the repository. You can install the required packages using npm install and run both the frontend and backend applications.

Backend:
cd backend, 
npm install, 
node server.js, 
Backend runs on: http://localhost:3000

Frontend:
cd frontend, 
npm install, 
npm run start, 
Frontend runs on: http://localhost:4200

Features:
User registration and login, 
Product creation and management (MongoDB), 
Orders created by users using selected products, 
Public API integration, 
JWT-based authentication

Tech Stack:
Angular, 
Node.js, 
Express, 
MongoDB,
MySQL
